Run `terraform apply`.

It's going to fail. This is the first time you use an external provider code (`Local`) 
through `local_file` resource. And the `Template` of course. You need to get if first.

Run `terraform init`.


Try run `terraform apply -auto-approve` again.


Make it fail in a lot of different ways.
Manipulate every piece of the code and see what happens.





Ideas:
- modify the file path, especially the `path.module` interpolation
- modify the content of the template file in different ways
- rename the template file to match the end result path
- remove the `jsonencode` from the `foos` var in the template
